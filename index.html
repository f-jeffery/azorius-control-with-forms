                Imagine this: your opponent casts their favorite card.  You can see the joy it brings them.  And you let it happen.  You don't have to say "no" to fun before it even hits the table.  You untap and pay six for Colossal Dreadmaw.  You're playing Magic as Richard Garfield intended.  You're <strong>free</strong>.
